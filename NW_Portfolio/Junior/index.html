			<h3>Academic</h3>

			<h4>Goal</h4>
			<p>My Junior Year Academic Goal is to continue working towards finishing the A-G
			requirments. To achieve this goal I plan to:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Write out a course list of whats completed and left to complete</li>
					<li>Sign up for any classes left to complete</li>
					<li>Take extra courses over the summer to make up for anything missed</li>
				</ol>
			
			<h4>Evidence #1</h4>
			<p>Course Planner: My course planner is the overview of all my completed courses, as well as what 
			I have left to complete to meet my A-G requirments. The creation of this list will give me a read-out of what i need to plan
			for for the remainder of my highschool career. This document shows that I am a quality producer.</p>
			
			<h4>Evidence #2</h4>
			<p>Portfolio Page: This portfolio page itself is a representation of my academic success. Not just the completetion 
			of the website, but the creation of it. This portfolio website has been completely coded and edited manually, as
			well as uploaded to the internet. This project is a represantation of my technological literacy, and how I am a quality 
			producer.</p>
			
			<h4>Evidence #3</h4>
			<p>Physics Keystone Project: My keystone project for Physics is the culmination of all the years work in a final, self driven lab.
			I put all my effort and knowledge into creating a project to go above and beyond the requirment. This project was self built, tested,
			and then turned into a hand coded website. This shows i am not only a quality producer, but also technologically literate. Through out
			the keystone project I also assisted many other students in completing their projects, showing i am a community contributor and effective collaborator.</p>
			
			<h4>Evidence #4</h4>
			<p>End of year grades: My end of the year grades are a representation of the hard work and dedication i have put
			into my school year. These grade reflect on my abilities as a quality producer, and my ability to be technologically
			literate.</p>
